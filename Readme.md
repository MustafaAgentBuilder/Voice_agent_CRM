## üéØ Project Overview

You‚Äôre building **AI Voice + Agentic Customer Support** agents that:

* Handle real voice calls (appointment booking, lead qualification, support, FAQ via IVR)
* Integrate with **CRM** and **calendar systems**
* Support multilingual, realistic voice synthesis and real-time speech recognition

Goal: Choose and integrate a CRM that aligns with this AI-voice agent workflow.

---

## 1. **Integrating CRM with OpenAI Agents SDK**

* Use CRM **REST API** from inside your agent via Python tools:

  ```python
  @tool
  def create_hubspot_contact(name, email): ...
  ```
* Register the tool in your agent workflow, enabling automated CRM actions.
* For no-code agents (e.g., AgentVoice, Synthflow), connect CRM via built-in connectors or automation platforms like **Zapier**, **Make**, or **Pipedream**.
